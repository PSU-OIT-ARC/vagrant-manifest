#TODO List

    “y_auth_cas.conf” -  remove it.
    Make all the puppet files run automatically
    Copy .vimrc file and .vim directory to the root’s home dir (mdj2 will do it)
    Copy some sample vhosts to /etc/httpd/vhosts.d (mdj2 is glad to add them)
    Change the ServerName in httpd.conf to vagrant.local or something like that
    Set the timezone to PST 
    The Vagrantfile should specify a host-only IP for the machine (like 10.0.0.10)
    Bash alias for vi=vim
